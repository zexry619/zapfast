## Install

The [Download page](/download/) has packages and archives for Linux,
macOS, and Windows.

Or build from source with a recent stable [Rust](https://rustup.rs):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crmne/zapfast zapfast
cd zapfast
cargo install --path .
zapfast
```

On Linux, `cargo install` puts the binary on your `PATH` but does not add a
launcher entry. To get one (ZapFast under your application launcher, with its
own icon and no terminal), install a release build instead:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
packaging/install-user.sh
```

This installs the binary, the icon, and a desktop file under `~/.local` (or
`$PREFIX`) and writes that desktop file's `Exec=` as the quoted full path to the
binary it just installed, so the entry works even when `~/.local/bin` is not on
the session's `PATH`. `install-user.sh` is Linux-only; on macOS and Windows a
source build has no launcher integration.

The build needs a C/C++ toolchain, CMake, and Perl (for the bundled
OpenSSL); `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the Rust version. On Linux it also needs
egui's development libraries and ALSA. libopus and the H.264 decoder build
from source. On Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed alsa-lib libxkbcommon wayland cmake perl
```

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake perl libasound2-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

With Nix, `nix develop` provides the toolchain and every native dependency,
and `nix run .#zapfast` builds and runs it.

The packaged desktop entry is `packaging/applications/zapfast.desktop`;
`packaging/install-user.sh` derives the user copy above from it.

## Link with your phone

ZapFast links as a companion device, like WhatsApp Web. Start it and either:

- scan the QR code with your phone (WhatsApp, **Settings**, **Linked
  devices**, **Link a device**), or
- click **Link with phone number** and enter the eight-character code on your
  phone.

The link survives restarts. Your phone does not need to stay on the same
network or be online to read messages already stored in ZapFast.

Several numbers can stay linked in one window. Click your own picture at the
top of the chat list to switch between them or to add another (**Settings >
Account > Add account** works too); a dot on it means another number has
unread chats. `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Command+Shift+A on macOS) switches to the next
number. Each number keeps its own keys, archive, media, and
notification, receipt, download, and wallpaper settings.

## Message history

After linking, the phone sends recent history. The chat list appears within
seconds, and messages can take a few minutes to finish loading. ZapFast stores
new messages in its own archive. When you scroll past the stored history,
ZapFast asks your phone for older messages. The phone must be online.

## Try it in your own chat

Use WhatsApp's **Message yourself** chat to try messages, reactions, edits,
voice messages, and attachments privately.
