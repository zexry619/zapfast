## Why ZapFast

WhatsApp has no official Linux app. ZapFast is a native WhatsApp client
written in Rust with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). It connects through
[whatsapp-rust](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust). ZapFast is a
single binary with no browser engine and uses a layout similar to WhatsApp Web.
In our Linux test, it opens in under a second and uses about 200 MB of idle
RAM, compared with 1.13 GB for WhatsApp Web and its Chromium processes.
[See the measurements](/benchmarks/).

## What it does

- **Stores your chats.** ZapFast links as a companion device and stores
  messages in one SQLite file. History remains after restart, and older
  messages are fetched from your phone as you scroll.
- **Sends common message types.** Send formatted text, replies, edits,
  reactions, forwards, pictures, files, stickers, GIFs, and recorded voice
  messages.
  You can add captions to attachments before sending them.
- **Plays media in the chat.** Voice messages, GIFs, and animated stickers
  play in place. The required audio and video decoders are built in.
- **Uses interactive messages.** Business templates show their text, images,
  and options. Reply buttons and simple lists send the selected response with
  a quote, web links open in your browser, and copy-code buttons use the clipboard. [See examples and limitations](/using-zapfast/#interactive-messages).
- **Uses consistent names.** Choose address-book names or public WhatsApp
  profile names for chats, mentions, replies, and notifications.
- **Runs in the background.** Closing the window keeps ZapFast in the system
  tray. Notifications can show the chat picture and open the chat at the
  message they announced. Supported desktops show the unread count on the app
  icon in the taskbar or dock; on Windows, the count appears while the window
  has a taskbar button. Muting a chat also mutes it on your phone.
- **Calls.** Voice and video calls, one to one, with incoming calls taking over
  the window to accept or decline. Microphone, speaker, and camera are chosen
  inside the call and remembered. [See calling](/using-zapfast/#calling).
- **Copies message text.** Select part of a message or copy across messages
  with the time, date, and sender included.

## What it does not do yet

ZapFast does not currently support:

- Sharing your screen in a 1:1 call: the whatsapp-rust revision ZapFast uses
  carries screen sharing for group calls only, so the control is disabled. OBS
  Virtual Camera stands in for it. [See calling](/using-zapfast/#calling).
- Status posts, communities, newsletters, and group administration.
- Playing ordinary videos in the app; they open in your player. Voice
  messages and GIFs do play in place.
- Replying with an attachment (replying with text or a voice message
  works).
- Interactive forms, payments, shopping flows, carousel selections, or forwarding
  interactive messages. Use these in WhatsApp Web or on your phone. Embedded
  videos, documents, and templates without readable text
  also need another client.

When reporting [an issue](https://github.com/crmne/zapfast/issues), include
what happened, what you expected, and when it happened. This helps match the
problem to the log in the state directory.

## Account safety

ZapFast is an **unofficial** client. Using it may be against WhatsApp's terms
of service. It uses WhatsApp's companion-device protocol, sends normal
receipts, and does not automate or send messages in bulk. WhatsApp may still
restrict accounts that use unofficial clients. Use an official client if you
cannot accept that risk.

## Prior art

ZapFast connects through
[whatsapp-rust](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust), which grew out
of the [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) lineage. WhatsApp
Web defines the companion-device model. ZapFast is a sibling of
[Spotifast](https://spotifast.rocks), a native client for Spotify. Both are
built on [fastframe](https://github.com/crmne/fastframe), the shared foundation
for native Rust apps built with egui.

ZapFast is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by
WhatsApp LLC or Meta. WhatsApp is a trademark of WhatsApp LLC.
