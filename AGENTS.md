# ZapFast agent guide

ZapFast is a small native WhatsApp client: Rust, egui, and the
[whatsapp-rust](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust) library for the
protocol. These notes are for coding agents and new contributors.

## Product boundaries

- Keep it a small native client. No browser engine, no telemetry, no
  hosted backend, no ZapFast-operated account system. Features never send
  message content to a third party.
- Do not vendor, fork, or patch upstream crates (egui, epaint, whatsapp-rust)
  in this repository. Fix them upstream.
- The protocol comes from whatsapp-rust. Do not reimplement pieces of it
  here, and do not advertise a capability merely because a protobuf field
  for it exists.
- Do not broaden a task into adjacent features or a general refactor.
  Preserve existing user behaviour unless the task changes it.
- Current limitations are not product exclusions. Before marking a report
  out of scope, identify the explicit boundary it conflicts with and check
  the relevant implementation and reported version. A missing feature,
  download limit, or stale guide does not establish a permanent boundary.

## Privacy

- The user's archive is personal data. Do not read chat rows, message
  bodies, contacts, or other user content out of `archive.db` or any
  exported log, not even read-only. Schema, column existence, and row
  counts are fine; message contents are not.
- When a bug report or feature needs the user's data, hand the user the
  query or command to run and let them report the result back.
- Never log message contents, phone numbers, keys, or QR payloads at a
  level that ships (see the definition of done); treat existing
  captures of them the same way.

## Architecture

- `src/ui/` draws views and pushes `model::Action`s; `src/app.rs` applies
  them after the frame. Never mutate application state from inside a view
  beyond the view's own fields (composer text, search text, flags).
- `src/backend.rs` is the interface's handle to a tokio runtime on its own
  thread; `src/backend/worker.rs` runs there. Each account owns one
  `Backend`. It owns the whatsapp-rust `Bot`, the message archive,
  downloads, and profile pictures. The two sides talk only through
  `Command` (interface to runtime) and `Event` (runtime to interface);
  every event wakes the window through `Waker`.
- Several WhatsApp accounts may be linked in one process. Each account has
  its own folder under `state/accounts/<id>/` (`session.db`, `archive.db`,
  stickers) and `cache/accounts/<id>/` (media, avatars). Never mix files,
  caches, or SQLCipher keys across accounts. `ChatId` is unique only inside
  one account. Notifications, tray clicks, and search hits always carry an
  `AccountId`. `src/app.rs` is the process shell (theme, window, tray,
  updates). Each `Account` in `src/account.rs` owns a `Backend`/`Worker`.
  Views draw the active account through `App`'s `Deref` to `Account`.
  Our own avatar at the top of the chat list opens the account switcher
  (`src/ui/accounts.rs`) on every platform: only the accounts (picture, name
  or number, unread chats, a check on the one on screen) and Add account; the
  settings keep their own button. A dot on the avatar means another account
  has unread chats. Events from an account that is not on screen are
  applied with `App::events_hidden` set: they update that account only, never
  the window's composer, dialogs, playback, or read state (a hidden account's
  remembered chat is not being read, so it sends no receipts). Process-wide
  settings (download folder, proxy) go to every backend. `paths.rs` moves a
  single-account layout into `accounts/1/` at startup, after logging starts:
  it refuses when anything is in the way, copies and reads back the archive's
  keyring key before moving it, and moves SQLite side files before their
  database. Removing an account deletes its folders after its backend has
  stopped, then its keyring entry.
- `src/archive.rs` is the SQLite store of chats, messages, contacts, and
  privacy-id mappings. The phone sends recent history at link time and can
  supply older history on request, but recovery is not guaranteed. Preserve
  the local archive. It keeps each message's raw protobuf because
  the keys to fetch an attachment live in it. `src/archive/encryption.rs` opens
  the archive with SQLCipher and a random key stored in the OS keyring. Plaintext
  migration checkpoints the old WAL and verifies an encrypted staging file before
  atomic replacement. A locked or missing key stops linking; never fall back to
  a disposable archive. Tests use fixtures and mock credentials only.
- `src/model.rs` holds the app's own types. Views never touch a protobuf;
  the worker translates in `classify()` and `parse_conversation()`.
- A motion photo is a photo plus a short clip sent as a second message in an
  `associatedChildMessage` wrapper. The clip is never a message: its bare
  video message goes to the archive's `motion_clips`, keyed by chat, photo id,
  and sender, and only the photo's own sender gives it a clip. `Content::Image`
  carries `motion`; the badge downloads the clip on a click
  (`Command::DownloadMotion`, cache only, same limit) and plays it muted through
  `animation::frame`; the image preview plays it through `Action::ExpandVideo`. Other wrapped children are not handled.
- Individual **Delete for me** uses `Command::DeleteLocal` to send through
  `chat_actions().delete_message_for_me`, removing the local copy only after
  WhatsApp accepts it. `DeleteMessageForMeUpdate` applies deletions from other
  devices. The encrypted archive retains pending requests and deletion barriers
  so reconnects retry uncertain requests and history cannot restore deleted
  messages. Confirmed deletions with failed local cleanup are repaired without
  another send. Recovery and callbacks remain bound to the originating account.
  This sync landed after 0.19.0; that release's local-only behavior was a missing
  integration, not a product exclusion. Whole-chat deletion and clearing sync too.
- Favorite chats sync with the phone through the `favorites` app-state action
  (RegularHigh), which carries the whole ordered list: `Event::FavoritesUpdate`
  replaces ours and `send_app_state_action(&schemas::FAVORITES, ..)` writes it.
  `archive/favorites.rs` keeps the list in order with each entry's JID as the
  phone named it, plus a queue of changes made here; a phone list applies
  (unless older than the newest applied) and the queue replays on top.
  `backend/worker/favorite_chats.rs` sends one list at a time with backoff and
  never before the phone's list is known: the first connection reads
  RegularHigh once as a snapshot, and its completion on the same queue as the
  replayed mutations means a phone without favorites. A blind write would
  replace the phone's list. Channels are never favorites. The Favorites chip
  follows the list order; pins stay global and first in every chip.
- Interactive messages are parsed in `backend/worker/interactive.rs`. Views receive
  labels and local capabilities, never protocol option ids. `ReplyInteractive`
  carries only the archived message id and visible button/choice indices;
  `interactive/replies.rs` re-resolves them from raw protobuf and uses the library's
  quote context and normal send path. Only known quick replies and single-select
  lists may send responses. Copy-code actions stay local. Do not turn arbitrary
  flow JSON into replies or fall back to sending its visible label as plain text.
  The versioned archive backfill must preserve downloaded image paths and edits.
  Carousel cards retain independent images and local actions. Download commands
  carry an optional card index, and the archive stores each image path separately.
  The version-4 backfill preserves those paths when rebuilding derived content.
  See [compatibility notes](docs/interactive-message-actions.md) for response
  families, source references, and live-test limits.
- Poll creation, voting, and decryption use whatsapp-rust's `Client::polls()`.
  `backend/worker/polls.rs` retains the original creator identity and key in the
  encrypted archive; `archive/polls.rs` keeps each voter's latest timestamp and
  message id, including encrypted updates whose parent has not arrived yet.
  History replay must not undo a newer vote or withdrawal. Decryption runs in
  batches of eight, with failures retried after reconnecting. The interface receives
  option counts, its own selection, and the latest decrypted voter names/times
  for the results dialog, never keys or protobufs. New, non-offline poll creations
  received through normal delivery start with a complete zero-vote baseline,
  persisted in `poll_history`. PDO recovery and
  duplicate deliveries do not establish that baseline. Visible polls without a
  complete baseline request phone history automatically, anchored after the
  creation message so the response includes its vote snapshot. `poll_history.rs` serializes these
  requests and retries from 30 seconds to 15 minutes without an interface timer.
  History request timestamps are Unix seconds: the library argument and wire
  field misleadingly end in `Ms`. Do not multiply archive timestamps by 1,000.
  A repeated poll question with no usable vote snapshot cannot finish recovery.
- Chat ids are canonical strings: a chat behind a privacy id (`@lid`) is
  filed under its phone number once the mapping is known. Use
  `Worker::canonical` for anything that arrives as a `Jid`.
- Updates come from fastframe-update: `src/updates.rs` holds ZapFast's
  `UpdateConfig` (legacy `fastsapp` names, the publisher key) and the
  proxy-aware client. It downloads verified GitHub releases and hands
  installation to a helper after an explicit restart action. `main` calls
  `fastframe_update::intercept` before anything else, so `--apply-update`,
  `--update-receipt` and `--update-error` keep working with older releases'
  helpers (`tests/update_flags.rs`). Portable releases carry
  `packaging/zapfast-portable.txt`; the Windows installer has its own marker.
- Custom themes come from fastframe-theme (`theme::Catalog`, ZapFast's
  `fastframe_theme::Palette` impl in `src/theme.rs`): it scans local JSON
  palettes off the UI thread, and the app caches the last usable choice in
  settings, with the palettes shared with Spotifast embedded as defaults. On Linux filesystem notifications reload the catalog and the active
  Omarchy palette without a repaint timer; following Omarchy does not require
  packaged assets. Changing `contrib/omarchy/zapfast.json.tpl` means saving the
  old text in `contrib/omarchy/previous/` and listing it in
  `omarchy_previous_templates`, so untouched installed copies are upgraded. Native packages ship optional hooks and templates, preserving
  existing per-user files. `reload-themes` uses the single-instance channel
  without opening a window.
- `src/theme.rs` owns colours, fonts, and icons; `src/ui/widgets.rs` the
  shared controls. New icons go in `assets/icons/` as 24px Lucide-style SVGs
  and in the `fastframe_icons::icons!` table; an icon fastframe-icons already
  ships is named there as `lucide "name"` instead of copied.
- `src/markup.rs` turns WhatsApp's text markup, links, and mentions into an
  egui `LayoutJob`; `src/emoji.rs` hands emoji to fastframe-emoji, which
  swaps every emoji for a placeholder glyph at layout time and paints the
  platform's picture over it afterwards (Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji
  through DirectWrite, or the desktop's bitmap emoji font, with the bundled
  Noto behind them). New pictures are drawn on its worker thread; tests and
  demo builds draw them inside the frame. The interface font is the
  platform's own (`fastframe_fonts::Primary::System`), and Inter in tests.
  fastframe-emoji's `EmojiPlugin` (added in `App::attach`) colours the
  emoji in every other egui text: labels, menus, tooltips, text fields. It
  leaves placeholders and `editor_job` glyphs alone, so the two never paint
  one emoji twice. Message text and chat names still go through
  `widgets::line` / `widgets::rich_text` or `markup::layout`: their
  placeholders keep the emoji-only sizing and let `transcript::refine`
  put copied emoji back.
- `src/animation.rs` plays animated stickers and GIFs: WebP/GIF frames
  decode in-process, and so do MP4s (the `mp4` crate demuxes, `openh264`
  decodes the H.264 WhatsApp uses, samples converted from AVCC to Annex
  B); `ffmpeg` is only a fallback for other codecs. `openh264` compiles
  its C++ from source with the C++ compiler of the host; `nasm` is
  optional and only adds the SIMD paths (the AUR recipes leave it out,
  the build works without it). Frames become textures on the interface
  thread and are dropped when unseen. A paused animation decodes only its
  first frame, the poster, and the rest once it plays: full decodes of a
  picker's paused stickers overran the frame budget and evicted each other.
- `src/video.rs` plays other videos inside their message, one at a time,
  with the same `mp4` and `openh264` pieces: a thread decodes from the
  keyframe before the start (openh264 must not flush after each packet or
  B-frames stop it) and streams scaled frames with presentation times; the
  interface thread shows the due frame in one texture. rodio's symphonia
  decodes the AAC track and its position steers the clock. Unsupported formats
  go to the system player. Playback reads a downloaded local file; the shared
  64 MiB attachment download limit applies to automatic and manual downloads,
  not to the video decoder. `Action::PlayVideo/SeekVideo/ToggleVideoSound` drive
  it; leaving the chat stops it and an unseen video pauses. Round video
  messages (PTV) are `Content::Video { note: true }` and draw as circles.
- Message bodies paint through `markup::paint_selectable` and single lines
  through `widgets::selectable_rich_text`: both hand the galley to
  `egui::text_selection::LabelSelectionState` (which paints it) and only
  overlay the colour emoji, so text can be swept and copied while
  `style.interaction.selectable_labels` stays false for every other label.
  The response must sense clicks and drags. `SelectionLeash` (an egui
  `input_hook` plugin) clamps a drag that started in the message view to
  just inside its edge once the pointer strays out (the platform keeps
  reporting a grabbed pointer beyond the window), and drops mid-drag
  `PointerGone`, so the selection keeps a row under it while the edge
  scroll brings more past. A copy that sweeps across
  messages is rebuilt by `src/transcript.rs` with `[time, date] Name:`
  per message (the phone's sharing format): every drawn body lands in
  `App::copy_rows` each frame, and the `CopyAnnotator` egui plugin
  rewrites the queued `CopyText` in `output_hook`, the only hook that
  runs after the selection plugin's own end-of-pass flush (plugins run
  in registration order and the built-ins come first, so end-pass
  callbacks fire too early).
  Selection galleys share the message viewport's horizontal bounds while
  retaining their glyph positions: otherwise egui considers short incoming
  and outgoing messages separate columns and will not sweep across them.
  Messages themselves are swept by a drag that starts on the strip beside
  the bubbles (which senses drags beneath the text), or anywhere on a row
  while selecting (the row's pick target sits above the text). `App::sweep`
  keeps the anchor and the selection it started from; the view maps the
  pointer's y to the last laid-out row above it each frame and the app
  selects by message order, so rows the list skipped during edge scroll
  count. Releasing the button ends the sweep, whichever widget held it.
- Group names and members come from `groups().get_metadata`, asked one
  turn at a time (two per 5 s tick, `pump_group_info`): dozens of unnamed
  groups arrive with history sync and a burst of queries hits the
  server's rate limit, which once left groups called "Group" forever.
  Failures back off (30 s doubling, seven tries); item-not-found,
  forbidden and not-authorized are final and stop the asking.
  The same metadata stores `is_locked` and our admin role
  (`chats.info_locked`, NULL until known, and `chats.group_admin`);
  `Chat::can_edit_info` gates renaming and the group photo in the group
  dialog. A rename lands only after WhatsApp accepts it, and bumps
  `subject_generation` so a metadata answer asked for earlier cannot restore
  the old subject. A refusal re-asks the metadata to relearn the rights.
- A download that answers 403/404/410 goes through
  `client.media_reupload().request(..)` (a server-error receipt; WhatsApp
  has the phone re-upload and answers with a fresh `direct_path`) and is
  fetched once more before the bubble reports "No longer on WhatsApp's
  servers". Download failures never toast; they live in the bubble as
  "... · click to retry". Copied text is refined by
  `transcript::refine`: emoji placeholders map back through each row's
  `placements`.
- History sync can bring a chat with a name and no messages at all; a
  history request for such a chat is anchored at the present with an
  empty message id (`worker::fetch_older`), and the app asks the phone
  as soon as such a chat loads or opens, instead of never.
- A Wayland compositor may stop sending frame callbacks to a window it isn't
  showing without saying so (Hyprland does for a window covered by a
  fullscreen or maximized one, #190), and a vsync swap there blocks the event
  loop and its ping replies, so the compositor calls the app unresponsive.
  The shared egui fork (crmne/egui apps-0.36, emilk/egui#8631) presents
  without a blocking swap on Wayland, paces frames by frame callbacks, and
  runs only `App::logic` when a redraw is 250 ms overdue; the winit fork
  (apps-0.30, rust-windowing/winit#4709) reports `suspended` as `Occluded`.
  Vsync stays on elsewhere. Spotifast, RekordFlash and TonePush pin the same
  two revisions; move them together. Repaints are event-driven, so nothing
  spins.
- `src/voice.rs` is the codec for voice messages: OGG/Opus in and out
  (the `ogg` crate for the container, `opus` with libopus bundled and
  built by cmake for the codec, so cmake is a build dependency), plus
  the 64-bar waveform WhatsApp draws and a mono/48 kHz resampler.
  `src/audio.rs` is the sound: `Player` plays one clip at a time through
  rodio (OGG/Opus through `voice`, MP3/M4A/WAV through rodio's decoders,
  decoded on a thread, the device opened on demand and released when the
  clip ends) and `Recorder` reads the default microphone through rodio's
  `Microphone` on a thread, keeping a loudness per 50 ms for the live bars.
  Linux needs ALSA headers to build (`libasound2-dev` on Debian,
  `alsa-lib` on Arch). `Action::PlayVoice/SeekVoice` drive the player from
  the bubble, and a clip that ends hands its message back
  (`Player::take_finished`) so the app plays the next unheard voice message
  of the same run (`App::next_voice_after`), keeping other apps' media paused
  in between; `StartRecording/CancelRecording/SendRecording` the
  microphone from the composer (the send button is a microphone when there
  is nothing to send); `Command::SendVoice` normalizes
  (`voice::normalize`, quiet takes up to just under full scale, gain
  capped), encodes and sends push-to-talk with the waveform and the reply
  quote if one was open; `Command::MarkPlayed` sends the played receipt
  once per incoming voice message. Own bubbles lay out right-aligned,
  where egui turns `ui.horizontal` right to left: rows like the voice
  player must use an explicit `Layout::left_to_right` at their own width.
  `src/ui/picker.rs` is the emoji/GIF/sticker panel. GIF search uses the
  key from Settings, else one baked in at build time from
  `ZAPFAST_GIPHY_KEY` (`option_env!`); the repository carries none. The
  phone's recently used stickers arrive in `HistorySync.recent_stickers`
  when the device links and live in the archive's `stickers` table as raw
  `StickerMetadata`, fetched when the picker opens. Favourite stickers sync
  both ways through `FavoriteStickerUpdate` and `schemas::FAVORITE_STICKER`;
  `backend/worker/stickers.rs` and `archive/stickers.rs` retain pending local
  changes and recover favourites synced before support was added.
- `src/paths.rs` moves a setup left by the app's earlier name
  (`fastsapp`, then `fastwhatsapp`) over once, so the linked device survives
  the rename. Migration runs after the single-instance guard and outside demos;
  keep the guard's `fastsapp:` wire identity compatible with running old copies.
- The app outlives the window, as in Spotifast: `main` hands the app to
  `fastframe_shell::Shell`, which runs `eframe::run_native` in a loop through
  App's `Resident` impl; closing the window with "keep running"
  on sets `hide_intent`, the window is destroyed, and a headless loop keeps
  calling `App::background_frame` (the link, the archive, the tray) until
  the tray, a clicked notification, or another launch sets `wants_show`,
  when a new window is made. The tray item is fastframe-tray (ksni on
  Linux, tray-icon on Windows and macOS; on macOS made with the first window
  and pumped by `fastframe_tray::idle` while none exists), and `src/macos.rs`
  hands its menu events to `fastframe_tray::claim_menu_event` first.
  Closing keeps ZapFast running, and a hidden start stays hidden, only while
  `Tray::is_shown`: on Linux the item exists before a panel shows it (a
  start at login beats the panel) and registers once one appears. A
  hidden start makes the macOS item with `Tray::create_item`, which does not
  bring ZapFast forward; a window's `attach` makes it otherwise.
  `src/single_instance.rs` claims fastframe-instance's slot in the runtime
  directory (`Slot::at(runtime, "fastsapp")`, so requests and replies stay
  `fastsapp:show` and `fastsapp:ok` for older copies), and a second launch
  asks the first to surface over a private socket (a token-checked loopback
  port on Windows); the handler queues `ControlCommand`s and declines unknown
  verbs. The fixed port 47119 that 0.15-era copies look for stays in ZapFast,
  answered once the slot is claimed. `src/notify.rs` sends desktop notifications
  for `Event::Incoming` (live messages from others, not history) when the
  reader is away from that chat; a click carries the chat and the message
  id, so the reader lands on the announced message. macOS has no title bar:
  the content runs to the top. `src/macos.rs` keeps native application menus alive across window
  recreation; `fastframe_macos::align_traffic_lights` centres the traffic
  lights on the chat header. Linking retains
  `ui::titlebar_strip`; other headers reserve horizontal space for the buttons.
- Group delivery uses `archive::receipts`: save the recipients when filing an
  outgoing message, record each person's receipt, then take the least advanced
  recipient. Never promote a group from one reader, apply a receipt to earlier
  messages, or infer a historical audience from current membership. History
  trusts the phone's aggregate status, not a partial `user_receipt` list.
- The app lock (`src/app_lock.rs`, `ui/lock.rs`) is a local screen lock, not
  encryption, and independent of the locked-chats code. Settings keep only a
  salted PBKDF2 verifier, checked and made on a thread. While locked,
  `ui::show` draws only the lock screen, `App::apply` drops every action
  outside `allowed_while_locked` (a clicked notification's message waits for
  the unlock), `window_focused` stays false so nothing is marked read, and
  notifications say only "New message". Unlinking (`LoggedOut`) forgets the
  password, which is how a forgotten one is recovered.
- Private read-state writes all use the `regular_low` app-state collection.
  `backend::read_sync` permits one at a time and backs off the whole queue after
  failure; per-chat retry queues would repeatedly rebuild the same failed
  collection. Pending positions stay in the archive until acknowledged. Snapshot
  recovery and no-progress conflict detection belong to whatsapp-rust.
- The name and icon under the phone's Linked devices come from
  `DevicePropsOverride` in `start_bot` (`os` is the name shown, the
  platform type picks the icon); WhatsApp reads them at pairing only, so a
  change shows after unlinking and linking again.
- Older history comes from the phone on demand (`Command::FetchOlder` →
  `Client::fetch_message_history` → a `HistorySync` chunk with
  `sync_type == ON_DEMAND`); the archive is paged first, the phone only
  when it is exhausted. Short and empty chats ask on their own, and a phone
  with nothing to add often leaves that unanswered, so only an `explicit`
  request (the reader scrolled to the top) reports a silent phone, once per
  chat until it answers or the link reconnects. A chunk saying nothing more
  remains on the phone sets `chats.history_start`, and that chat is not
  asked again.
  `ReloadHistory` requests before a selected archived message to repair gaps
  inside existing history, even after reaching the chat's start. History keeps
  edited snapshots under the protocol target id, even when the outer envelope
  names a different edit id. It uses `HistorySyncMsg.msg_order_id` to break
  timestamp ties in the archive, paging, and interface. A replay without order
  metadata must not erase it, and an unedited replay must not undo an edit.
  History `MESSAGE_EDIT` entries carry full snapshots, unlike live edit events:
  keep their envelope timestamp/order and normalize the body and target id.
  Do not require a separate original or create a bubble under the edit id.
  Count-only diagnostics can distinguish malformed snapshots from storage failures.
- Scrolling comes from fastframe-scroll: `App::scrolling.apply` runs first
  in each unlocked frame and sets the wheel step (120 points a notch), and on
  Linux scales touchpad gestures, glides after the lift, and holds a gesture
  to its axis (Shift turns it sideways). `App::route_scroll` then keeps a
  gesture, glide included, with the pane it began over (`ScrollRoute`, #274),
  asking `Scrolling::gliding`; the image preview pans with a touchpad and
  zooms with a wheel by `Scrolling::from_trackpad`.
- Platform-specific code belongs behind `cfg` blocks; a change for one
  platform must keep the other two compiling.

egui pitfalls this code has already hit:

- `consume_key(Modifiers::NONE, key)` also matches the key with Shift held
  (egui only insists on the modifiers you ask for), so the composer
  inspects the events itself to tell Enter from Shift+Enter.
- `consume_key` matches the logical key, and with Shift held US-style
  layouts report `[` and `]` as `{` and `}` (and `=` as `+`), so a Shift
  shortcut binds both spellings: see the bracket and `Plus`/`Equals` rows in
  `ui/keys.rs`. Layouts that put another character on the shifted key never
  produce either spelling; `Alt+↑/↓` is the layout-independent way to switch
  chats. A long label in `SHORTCUTS` widens the dialog's key column and
  leaves its descriptions less room to wrap in; the dialog takes two columns
  in a wide window and scrolls in a short one.
- `with_layout(..., Align::Center)` directly inside a vertical container
  claims the whole available height; wrap it in `ui.horizontal`.
- `ui.horizontal` inside a right-aligned bubble lays out right to left;
  see `mirrored_row`. A bubble's own click target is registered before its
  contents (from last frame's rect) so links and quotes inside win clicks.
  The empty strip beside it is registered earlier still, before the row. A
  double-click on either replies; the body keeps it for selecting the word.
- `Popup::context_menu` opens on the *response's* right-click, which those
  inner widgets take for themselves; the bubble reads the right-click from
  the input over its row (the bubble and the strip beside it) inside the
  transcript viewport (the chat header shares its layer) and opens
  `Popup::menu` itself, so the menu comes up anywhere on the message.

## Branches

Use trunk-based development. Work on `main` and keep releasable work there.
Commit directly to `main`, one topic per commit, with each commit compiling and
passing the relevant checks on its own. Feature branches and pull requests are
for outside contributors; the maintainer's own work, and work done with the
maintainer, does not go through them. Do not create or push a branch unless the
maintainer explicitly asks for one.

Keep `main` linear. Squash outside pull requests into one focused commit while
preserving contributor credit. Never create or push merge commits. When
updating a local checkout, use fast-forward-only pulls and rebase unpublished
local commits if needed. Before pushing, verify that the commits being added
contain no merge commits. Rewriting published history requires explicit
maintainer approval, an exact force-with-lease guard, and a recovery ref.

Every normal release, including a release candidate or other prerelease, must
tag a commit already pushed to and reachable from `origin/main`. A release
branch is allowed only for an explicitly requested backport to an older
supported line. Prefer fixing forward on `main`; do not create backport or
release branches speculatively.

## Releasing

Never use em dashes in user-facing writing, including release titles, release
notes, and agent responses. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or full stops.

Before writing release notes, read the previous two stable releases of
`../spotifast` and match their style: a short plain-language summary, `New`
and `Fixed` sections with bold user-facing results, a `Thanks` section, and
a full-changelog link. Credit who did what on the relevant item, with issue
or PR numbers, and acknowledge reporters separately from implementers.
Include screenshots or short videos of the main features, especially Omarchy
theme integration when relevant. Capture only synthetic offline demo content,
never real chats. Upload the media as assets of the GitHub release and link
those URLs from the notes; never commit screenshots or recordings to the
repository. Verify every media link and do not leave generated notes
in place. Describe known limitations honestly.

Do not cut a release for every fix. Work accumulates on `main` until
there is something substantial to announce: a feature, or a batch of
fixes worth a changelog entry. Five patch releases in a day is what this
rule exists to prevent. The exception is a regression in something just
released, which goes out as soon as it is fixed.

A release is not finished when the tag is pushed. Do these in order:

1. From a clean, up-to-date `main`, bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, add the
   release to the `<releases>` list in the Flatpak metainfo, and update
   `Cargo.lock` with a build. Write the release notes, in the style above, to
   `packaging/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`: the release workflow publishes that
   file as the release description, and a stable tag without it fails. Link
   screenshots at the release's asset URLs
   (`https://github.com/crmne/zapfast/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/NAME.png`).
   Run the full checks, commit, and push `main`. Before tagging, verify the
   release commit is reachable from `origin/main` so the binaries report the
   right version and the release contains the canonical history.
2. Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag. Wait for every platform build, artifact,
   and `checksums.txt`.
3. Upload the screenshots to the release as assets with the names the notes
   link, then open the published release and check the text, every image,
   and every download link. Never leave generated placeholder notes.
4. After the release files exist, update both `zapfast_version` in
   `docs/_config.yml` and the version menu in `docs/_data/versions.yml`.
   The menu lists only the current version, which points to `/download/`,
   and the Changelog link; do not add older versions to it. Never point the
   download page at files that do not exist yet. Set `release_asset_prefix` to
   `zapfast` and `release_app_name` to `ZapFast` only once those assets exist.
5. Update the AUR packages from the templates in `packaging/arch/`. The shared
   packaging workflow generates versions, hashes and `.SRCINFO` after the
   release exists, and publishes when `PUBLISH_AUR` and the required secrets
   are configured. Otherwise use `native-packages` to build, stage,
   review and publish the generated recipes; see `PACKAGING.md`. Validate
   native builds with `makepkg -f`. A recipe-only `zapfast-git` change does
   not require an application release.

## Definition of done

- Add focused tests for changed behaviour. The `demo` feature carries sample
  data and a headless layout test of every screen (`src/demo.rs`); extend
  the sample when a new kind of content or state is added, and use
  `--demo-shot` to look at the result.
- Update the docs site (`docs/`) when user-visible behaviour, settings,
  files, or network access changes. The README stays a short pointer to it.
- Run the full checks before finishing:

  ```sh
  cargo fmt --all --check
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  cargo test --locked --all-targets
  cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features
  RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --locked --all-features --no-deps
  ```

  Do not weaken a lint, delete a test, or add an `allow` merely to make
  them pass without explaining why the rule does not apply.
- Report platform coverage honestly: say what was run and what was only
  compiled.
- Never log message contents, phone numbers, keys, or QR payloads at a
  level that ships. The log file is meant to be attached to bug reports.

## Disk use

Builds go through [mbx](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev), enabled for mise users
by `mise.toml` (run `mise trust` once in each new checkout or worktree, or
mise refuses to run `cargo` there). It keeps compiled work in one shared
store, places each checkout's `target/` under a disk budget, and collects old
outputs on its own. Plain `cargo` still works for contributors who do not use
mise or mbx.

- Give each worktree and each parallel agent its own target directory. A
  worktree's own `target/` is enough, and mbx manages it; a second build in
  the same checkout uses `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/<name>`, which stays inside
  the managed target. Never point builds at a shared target directory: Cargo's
  lock serializes them, one worktree's test run can execute another's binary,
  and the store already shares compiled outputs.
- Never vary `codegen-units` or other compiler flags per agent. Each variant
  is a separate cache entry and fills the disk.
- Do not `cargo clean` to save space. `mbx gc --dry-run` previews collection
  and `mbx gc` runs it now; `mbx cache stats` shows what is held.
- When a build is colder than expected, `mbx explain --last` says what missed
  the cache and why.
- Never put build output or large scratch files in `/tmp`. It is a small
  in-memory filesystem with a per-user quota, and filling it breaks every
  shell on the machine.
- Delete one-off QA, packaging, and release-validation directories (under
  `.cache/` or `~/.cache/`) once their result is recorded.
