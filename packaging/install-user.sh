# Installs a source build for the current user: the binary, the icon, and a
# launcher entry that opens ZapFast with no terminal.
#
# Usage: packaging/install-user.sh [binary] [prefix]
#   binary  the built executable (default: target/release/zapfast)
#   prefix  the install prefix   (default: $PREFIX, else ~/.local with data
#           in $XDG_DATA_HOME when it is set)
#
# The desktop file in packaging/ names its binary as `Exec=zapfast`, which is
# right for a package: a package manager installs the binary to /usr/bin,
# where every session finds it on PATH. A user install lands in ~/.local/bin,
# which a graphical session often does not put on PATH, so `Exec=zapfast`
# would find nothing and the launcher entry would do nothing when clicked.
# This script therefore writes the installed entry with the full path to the
# binary it just installed, computed here at install time. No machine's path
# is written into the repository.

# The path is quoted and escaped the way a Desktop Entry's Exec key wants, the
# same rules src/autostart.rs applies to the tray entry, because a home
# directory like `/home/alice/Zap Fast` is valid: unquoted, the launcher would
# read that as an executable plus an argument and the entry would do nothing.

# backslash escapes in the value before the script sees it, so a prefix
# containing `\n` would gain a newline and the Exec would no longer match
# where the binary actually landed. ENVIRON values are used verbatim.
