//! The worker's side of a 1:1 call: commands, signaling routing, and media events.
//!
//! One call at a time. [`Worker::call`] holds the only one, and every entry point here refuses to
//! start or accept a second while it exists — a double click, a second chat's call button, and a
//! second inbound offer all land on the same refusal.
//!
//! The state the UI renders is never computed here: it comes from the backend. `<accept>` moves an
//! outgoing call out of dialing, the media plane's `RelayAllocated` is what makes a call Active and
//! starts the timer, and a `<reject>`/`<terminate>`/relay loss ends it with the reason the peer
//! gave. Nothing is inferred from the button that was pressed.
