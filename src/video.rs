//! In-app playback for video messages and round video notes.
//!
//! One video plays at a time. A thread demuxes the MP4 with `mp4`, decodes
//! its H.264 track with `openh264` (as `animation` does for GIFs), and hands
//! over scaled RGBA frames tagged with their presentation time. The interface
//! thread shows the newest frame that is due and uploads it into a single
//! texture. Sound plays through rodio, whose symphonia backend decodes the
//! AAC track, and its position steers the clock while it lasts. Other codecs
//! are reported so the video can open in the system player instead.
