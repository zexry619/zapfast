//! Camera capture: the node read directly, with `ffmpeg` only as a fallback.
//!
//! On Linux the camera is read through V4L2 itself. The node is opened, its packed format is chosen,
//! and frames are read straight into the encoder's buffer, so nothing external is needed to make a
//! video call work. `ffmpeg` is started only when a node cannot be read that way, because AGENTS.md
//! keeps it as a fallback rather than a requirement.
//!
//! Discovery is native too: `/dev/video*` is walked and each node is asked what it is through
//! `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` and `VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT`, rather than shelling out to `v4l2-ctl`. No external
//! tool is needed to list a camera or to open one.
//!
//! A platform without a capture here reports no camera at all, and a call offers none. That is
//! [`crate::calls::CallCapabilities::camera`], built from [`available`].
//!
//! Every frame is YUV 4:2:0, tightly packed, in the size the encoder was built for: the preview and
//! the encoder both read a known layout, and a portrait camera stays portrait because the size
//! comes from what the driver grants.
