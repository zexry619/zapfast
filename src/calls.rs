//! 1:1 WhatsApp calling: signaling, media, audio devices, camera, and state.
//!
//! Audio goes through rodio, the same layer the rest of the app plays and records with, so a call
//! opens the platform's own audio API on every platform it ships for rather than shelling out to
//! `pw-record` and `pw-play`. The engine's 16 kHz mono frames meet whatever rate and channel count a
//! device wants inside [`crate::call_audio`], and each direction sits behind a *stable* channel, so
//! changing the input or output device replaces only the stream behind it without the engine ever
//! seeing a port close.
//!
//! Video is H.264 Annex-B both ways, because that is what the library transports: it never touches
//! pixels. Capture encodes with the `openh264` encoder the app already links, and the peer's access
//! units decode back to `egui` images with the `openh264` decoder `crate::video` already uses.
//! Frames cross to the UI through [`VideoTick`]; no decode work happens on the UI thread.
