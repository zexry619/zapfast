# ZapFast

**WhatsApp, native and fast.** ZapFast is a WhatsApp client for Linux, macOS,
and Windows, written in Rust with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and
[whatsapp-rust](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust). It links to your
phone as a companion device and has no browser engine. In our Linux test it
opens in under a second and uses about 200 MB of idle RAM, against 1.13 GB for
WhatsApp Web. [See the measurements](https://zapfast.rocks/benchmarks/).
